# VideoPy
## What is VideoPy?

VideoPy is an application built on top of the MoviePy library, designed to streamline the process of creating videos through the use of YAML files. By defining video scenarios in YAML, VideoPy allows users to automate common video creation tasks, making it accessible even to those with minimal programming experience.

## How Does It Work?

With VideoPy, you can define aspects of your video in a simple, human-readable YAML file. Hereâ€™s an example:

```yaml
output_path: "outputs/example.mp4"
width: 640
height: 960
fps: 24
frames:
- type: "plugins.core.frames.image"
  time:
  duration: 5
  configuration:
  file_path: "example/assets/image/1.jpg"
  blocks:
    - type: "plugins.core.blocks.text"
      position: [center, bottom]
      time:
      duration: 5
      configuration:
      content: "Image 1"
      effects:
        - type: "plugins.core.effects.blocks.text.typewrite"
          time:
            duration: 4
          configuration:
            duration_per_char: 0.1
        - type: "plugins.core.effects.blocks.text.background"
          time:
            duration: 5
          configuration:
            background_color: [ 255, 255, 255 ]
        - type: "plugins.core.effects.blocks.text.fadein"
          time:
            duration: 1
    - type: "plugins.core.blocks.audio"
      time:
      duration: 5
      configuration:
      file_path: "example/assets/audio/epic_sound.mp3"
      effects:
        - type: "plugins.core.effects.blocks.audio.play"
          time:
          duration: 5
          effects:
    - type: "plugins.core.effects.frames.resize"
      configuration:
      mode: "center_crop"
    - type: "plugins.core.effects.frames.fadein"
      time:
      duration: 1
```      
### In this scenario, the resulting video will:

Have dimensions of 640x960 pixels and a frame rate of 24 fps.
Include a single frame displaying an image (example/assets/image/1.jpg) with the text "Image 1" positioned at the bottom center and displayed with the "typewrite" effect.
Play background audio (example/assets/audio/epic_sound.mp3) for the duration of the frame.
Apply a fade-in effect at the start and resize the image to fit centrally.
Why Use VideoPy?

### VideoPy simplifies and automates the video creation process by allowing you to:

- Define video scenarios in a straightforward YAML format.
- Automate repetitive video creation tasks, reducing the need for advanced video editing software.
- Create custom scripts in Python that generate YAML scenario files, offering flexibility for more advanced users.

# Installation

## Git

1. Clone the repository
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the application using `python videopy.py run --scenario-file example/configs/example.yaml`

> More installation options coming in the future

# Modules

## What's a module?

Modules are the building blocks of VideoPy scenarios. They define the different components that make up a video, such as frames, blocks, effects, and more. Each module has a specific purpose and can be combined to create video scenarios.

## Scenarios

### Creating scenario
1. Create fully using YAML files. (`example/scenario.yaml`)
2. Create using Python scripts that generate these YAML files (`plugins/core/scenarios/images_dir_to_video.py`).

### Using scenarios from plugins

To list available scenarios use:
`python video.py scenarios`

To get more information about a specific scenario use:
`python video.py scenario <scenario_name>`

## Frames

To list available frames use:
`python video.py frames`

To get more information about a specific frame use:
`python video.py frame <frame_name>`

## Blocks

To list available blocks use:
`python video.py blocks`

To get more information about a specific block use:
`python video.py block <block_name>`

## Effects

To list available effects use:
`python video.py effects`

To get more information about a specific effect use:
`python video.py effect <effect_name>`
